      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Currently, I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at UC Irvine.
        When I'm not engineering software or creating my own side projects, 
        you'll likely find me exploring theological concepts or refining on my boxing combos in the gym! 
        I'm focused on the concept of developing the right mindset for continual self-improvement, as
        I believe that by bringing the best I can out of myself, I can better show up for the people around me both professionally and relationally. 
        In my downtime, I enjoy browsing and collecting vinyl records of various genres, 
        although my main focus is Japanese City Pop and Lofi. Feel free to connect with me if you want to chat about CS, personal growth, and life in general!</p>

      <h3>VR Badminton Simulation</h3>
      <h4>Unity 3D, Blender, C#, Vive HTC</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineered a virtual environment for training badminton strikes using Unity 3D and C#.</li>
        <li>Created a 3D model of a badminton racket and birdie for training.</li>
        <li>Applied basic physics concepts for realism in the simulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Main Lesson Learned: Be willing to explore different techniques for debugging.</h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Semantic Segmentation for Electricifcation</h3>
      <h4>Python, Pytorch Lightning, Pytorch</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Oversaw data processing and model training on satellite data from the IEEE GRSS 2021 ESD dataset to locate
          settlements without electricity.</li>
        <li> Collaborated in a team of 4 on programming scripts for model training and performance evaluation</li>
        <li> Achieved 91% training accuracy on the U2-Net and had a 6% validation accuracy increase compared to the baseline
          U-Net.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Main Lesson Learned: Be humble enough to work and learn from other teams.</h4>
    </div>
        
    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Sleep Water Exercise (SWE)</h3>
      <h4>Kotlin, Firebase's Realtime Database, Android Studios</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a recommendation health app for college students concerned about sleep, hydration, and exercise in a team of 4.</li>
        <li>Connected Google Firebase Realtime Database as backend into our app and developed frontend UI for logging in and creating accounts.</li>
        <li>Constructed a recommendation system to give each user personalized recommendations to improve lifestyle.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Main Lesson Learned: Test out different technologies for the intended tech stack earlier.</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Checkers AI</h3>
      <h4>Python, Bash</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Created an AI based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, which used probability to find the best way to victory.</li>
        <li>Implemented the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm needed by the AI using Python and developed a testing script to simulate the AI&apos;s performance over 1000 games.</li>
        <li>Achieved the 70th percentile out of approximately 250 participants in terms of performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Main Lesson Learned: Monte Carlo Tree Search for games requires inverse logic.</h4>
